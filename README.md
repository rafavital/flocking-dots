# Flocking DOTS
A flocking algorithm made using [Unity's Data Oriented Stack Technology](https://unity.com/dots)

## About
This project was the base of my graduation's final paper where I compared the performance between two flocking algorithms, one using Unity's default C# paradigm, and the other using Unity's ECS paradigm, available in DOTS. The counterpart of the C# paradigm is available [here](https://github.com/rafavla32/flocking-oo)

## Built With
- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/): version 2019.1.14f1.
